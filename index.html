                The Neurodiversity at Work Research Conference brings together leading scholars, neurodivergent leaders, neurodiversity practitioners, and leading neurodiversity employers concerned with advancing neurodiversity employment research. Their work may relate to the preparation, recruitment, persistence, and advancement of neurodivergent individuals in the workplace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal remains to build a community of people concerned with advancing research related to the preparation and employment of autistic individuals and convey these concerns to others in the community. The conference aims to:
            </p>
                <ol>
                <li> Provide a collaborative space for scholars to share their work and receive constructive feedback in order to advance neurodiversity employment research. </li>
                <li>Further develop a research agenda to advance evidence-based practices to equitably include neurodivergent people in the workplace. </li>
                </ol>
            <h3> Conference Theme </h3>
            <p> This year’s Conference theme centers on “Demonstrating Transformational Impact: moving from practice-based evidence to evidence-based practice.” Our keynote speaker and various panels will advance the community's understanding of and inspire research efforts to demonstrate impact systematically and critically to ensure the representation and empowerment of all community members and balance ecosystem stakeholders' perspectives equitably. Conference activities will facilitate dialogue related to transformational impact relevant to the following priorities we identified in the 5th Annual Neurodiversity at Work Research Workshop in Seattle in 2023, namely:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Emphasizing representation </li>
                    <li> Exploring the impact of the intersectionality of identities </li>
                    <li> Translating insights into evidence-based practice </li>
                </ol>
            <h3> Conference Format </h3>
            <p> The Neurodiversity at Work Research Conference will be in person this year at the University of Maryland campus in College Park, MD, USA, on May 30 and 31, 2024. There will be no hybrid or remote option though we will provide recordings of the presentations through the conference website afterwards. </p>
